<h1>Blog</h1>
<h2>September Week 4, 2025</h2>
<p>Hello everyone. This is my first entry for my blog. I hope you all enjoy.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know what to put. Maybe some stuff about the Rec Room and stuff like that. So for Rec Room, it's like an arcade with a bar, typical. The games there are the usual, PAC-MAN, Wheel of Fortune, table hockey, etc. The food is pretty good, the serving time is slow, but this isn't a fast food chain, so I can understand. The ticket prices are fairly ok, $35 (Canadian) for 160 tickets, pretty ok. Idk, it's pretty nice there. A great way to gamble away your savings. <b>8/10</b></p>

<h2>October Week 1, 2025</h2>
<p>Hello again. This is my 2<sup>nd</sup> entry.</p>
<p>To be honest, I might stop posting here, I have a <b>lot</b> of work to do. Anyways, today's topic is School Band. School Band isn't a cult and you should totally join it! (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧ All jokes aside, it's a great way to earn credits in highschool if you already play an instrument and can read <u>sheet music</u>. If you don't know how to, that's alright, you can always try to learn. Band is also a great way to meet people too.</p>
